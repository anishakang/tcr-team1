# CSE Team 1 Task 1 repository

###### **_Aim:_** 
To create a system that will take a visual input from the environment, process it, present it to the user and give a tangible output


###### **_Our Approach:_**
- Creating an OpenCV program illustrating the mechanism of detecting an object that is- A. green and B. round. This program then takes real-time input from the videostream and detects the green ball accordingly.
- Creating an HTML web interface to deploy the ball detection program upon successful integration of the OpenCV program into the web interface.
